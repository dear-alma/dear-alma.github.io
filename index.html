<h1>Dear Alma</h1> 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>

<p>Dear Alma,

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>
<p>There are a few fleeting moments each day, while children sleep or are cared for by assorted saints, when we have time and space to care for ourselves, enquire after each other, or look up and out to the world around us.  

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>
<p>It’s borrowed time and it passes quickly. We have a sense of how we’d like to fill these windows, but we can’t put a finger on exactly what we’re looking for. It’s nowhere to be found on mumsnet or instagram. It’s definitely not in the news. It’s not in a novel or even a weekend away, when we manage to pull them off.  Fresh air and a brisk walk helps, even when we’re not sure where we’re going or why. There’s a backlog of music and film - we’ve fallen out of the loop faster than we can get ourselves back in.  Work provides respite, or so they say, but it’s still work. Our friends are there for us, though we’re not always on the same page. We’re not discontent, not all of the time, but we’re definitely dissatisfied.

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>
<p>Alma means ‘kind or nourishing’. ‘Alma Mater’ is an allegorical Latin phrase for a school or university.  This Alma on the wikipedia page looks like she’s nailing it.  INSERT PICTURE OF HER BREASTFEEDING TEN BABIES. Mothers don’t mother around the clock, so once babies start to become less babyish and we get closer to feeling like our normal selves, we think it’s our brains that need the nourishment. Though our appetites might be sated by a cinnamon bun too, and Alma also happens to be a nice road in Bristol where we’d like to meet each other for a coffee one day. 

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>
<p>So that’s why we’re writing to you, dear Alma, for your thoughts. Because let’s face it, we barely had a moment to get this down on paper, let alone sense-check the idea. If we teamed together to publish something, in print or online, on your doormat or at your fingertips, what would you want to read or write about? We’d like to learn about the life of Mary Baker, the famous 19th century imposter who fooled the people of Bristol for years that she was a princess from a faraway land. We’d love to interview the team behind Project Mama, a bristol social enterprise helping asylum seekers through pregnancy and childbirth. One day (bear with us here, beyond all our wildest lockdown dreams) we might want to hear about the perfect plate of pasta and where to eat it. We’d delight in discovering the hidden monuments of Arnos Vale and the wooded pathways that lead us to them. We might even pause to read a poem or look at a piece of art, find out who created it and why it matters.  We’d like to cut long stories short so that our friends have time to read them. Would you?

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>
<p>When we all emerge from the haze of new motherhood and the small matter of a global pandemic,  there will be new places to go and more to life to care about. If we can find the community to carry us there, we’d prefer to discover these things together.  Tell us, honestly, if this is a good idea and if so how you might like to contribute. We can’t wait to suss this out together.

<span style="display:block; height: 10px;"></span>
<p><b>Love Izzy and Ellie</b>
